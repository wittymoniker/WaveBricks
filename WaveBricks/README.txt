INFO
	WaveBricks is a generative digital audiovisual workstation that produces shapes out of sinusoidal
	audio constructions. The program operates on scripts, where each instrument comes preprogrammed with 
	a demonstration script which determines a timbre and composition.


		/*SCRIPTING README
	*** REMEMBER: DELETE YOUR VOICES AUTOMATION SCRIPTS EVERY TIME YOU RESIZE THE INSTRUMENT VOICE COUNT.
	PUT FUNCTIONS LIKE ROOT, SIN, ETC in PARENTHESES, OR HAVE ANY AND ALL MULTIPLYING FACTORS BEFORE BUT NOT AFTER.
	REPRESENT ALL WHOLE NUMBERS AS FLOAT WITH .0.
	VOICES SPINNER MUST NEVER BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF VOICES LISTED IN SCRIPT. YOU MAY SET VOICES SPINNER TO THE 
	NUMBER OF WHICH THE SCRIPT CALLS FOR, IN ORDER TO TESSELLATE THE SHAPE MORE EFFECTIVELY.
	EVERY VOICES AND COMP SCRIPT MUST END WITH A STEP NUMBER THAT IS THE STEP +1 OR HIGHER, FOLLOWED BY A COMMA.
	SCRIPTING FOR COMPOSITION NOW RELIES ON SIX VARIABLES, THE STEP FOLLOWED BY AMP AND PITCH PLUS FM AND AM 
	INTENSITIES AND FREQUENCIES PER STEP IN THAT ORDER.
	
	BEGIN WITH NEW STEP FOR WHICH VOICES WILL TRANSISTION INTO ALONG WITH THE 3*12 INITIALIZERS, SEPARATED BY COMMAS. 
	CONTINUE.

	INTEGER STEPS, FLOAT EVERYTHING ELSE. GOOD PRACTICE TO REPRESENT EVERY WHOLE NUMBER WITH A .0.

	
	VOICES SCRIPTING:
	START WITH NO STEP NUMBER, COMMA SEPARATED AMP PITCH PHASE, REPEATED FOR EACH VOICE(12 DEFAULT). COLON SEPARATED,
	
	AMP,PITCH,PHASE (x Voices number) : (STEP), AMP,PITCH,PHASE (x Voices number):

	COMPOSITION SCRIPTING:

	STEP, AMP, PITCH,  FMINT, FMFREQ, AMINT, AMFREQ, DECAY TIME +/- STEP, DECAY INTENSITY +/- AMP, DECAY INTENSITY +/- PITCH: 
	STEP, AMP, PITCH, FMINT, FMFREQ, AMINT, AMFREQ, DECAY TIME +/- STEP, DECAY INTENSITY +/- AMP, DECAY INTENSITY +/- PITCH,       
	AMP, PITCH, FMINT, FMFREQ, AMINT, AMFREQ, DECAY TIME +/- STEP, DECAY INTENSITY +/- AMP, DECAY INTENSITY +/- PITCH : STEP,

	//Multiple notes per step in second  scripted step.

	*IF IT DOESN'T COMPOSE, YOU *PROBABLY* made a comma  or colon error or enumeration error.
