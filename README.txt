INFO
	WaveBricks is a generative digital audiovisual workstation that produces shapes out of sinusoidal
	audio constructions. The program operates on scripts, where each instrument comes preprogrammed with 
	a demonstration script which determines a timbre and composition.


SCRIPTING README
	*** REMEMBER: DELETE YOUR VOICES AUTOMATION SCRIPTS EVERY TIME YOU RESIZE THE INSTRUMENT VOICE COUNT.
	PUT FUNCTIONS LIKE ROOT, SIN, ETC in PARENTHESES, OR HAVE ANY AND ALL MULTIPLYING FACTORS BEFORE BUT NOT AFTER.
	VOICES SPINNER MUST NEVER BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF VOICES LISTED IN SCRIPT. YOU MAY SET VOICES SPINNER TO THE 
	NUMBER OF WHICH THE SCRIPT CALLS FOR, IN ORDER TO TESSELLATE THE SHAPE MORE EFFECTIVELY.
	
	BEGIN WITH NEW STEP FOR WHICH VOICES WILL TRANSISTION INTO ALONG WITH THE 3*12 INITIALIZERS, SEPARATED BY COMMAS. 
	CONTINUE.

	INTEGER STEPS, FLOAT EVERYTHING ELSE. GOOD PRACTICE TO REPRESENT EVERY WHOLE NUMBER WITH A .0.

	YOU CAN MULTIPLY NUMBERS (WITH *) BY PROPORTIONS OR VALUES, AND PROBABLY DO SIN() SQRT()/ROOT() AND THE ^ OPERATOR,
	BUT DO NOT DIVIDE.

	VOICES SPINNER DEFAULTS TO A RIDICULOUS 128 TO PREVENT A CRASH DEALING WITH VOICES NUMBER BEING
	LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SCRIPTED VOICES:
	ONCE YOUR SCRIPT IS FINISHED, TURN VOICES SPINNER DOWN FROM A HIGH NUMBER TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF VOICES
	SPECIFIED. THIS ELIMINATES EXTRA VERTICES WHICH WILL EXIST AT THE RELATIVE 0,0,0.
	THE PROGRAM SHOULD NEVER CRASH BESIDES THIS BUT YOU MUST NOT CLOSE ANY WINDOWS, OR ALL WILL CLOSE.
	
	VOICES SCRIPTING:
	START WITH NO STEP NUMBER, COMMA SEPARATED AMP PITCH PHASE, REPEATED FOR EACH VOICE(12 DEFAULT). COLON SEPARATED,
	
	AMP,PITCH,PHASE (x Voices number) : (STEP), AMP,PITCH,PHASE (x Voices number):
	PHASE SHOULD BE FROM 0.0000000000...1 to 2.0 but NOT zero.... zeroes should experimentally be represented by 0.0.

	COMPOSITION SCRIPTING:
	STEP, AMP, PITCH : STEP, AMP, PITCH, AMP, PITCH : //SET FIRST NOTE TO 0AMP,0PITCH if you have to. Multiple notes 
	per step in second step.

	

	DECAY:

	DECAY, STEP : DECAY, STEP

	*IF IT DOESN'T COMPOSE, YOU *PROBABLY* made a comma  or colon error or enumeration error.
